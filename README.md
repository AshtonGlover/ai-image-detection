# ai-image-detection

This program utilizes CNNs to determine whether or not an image is real or AI-Generated using two pixel-wise feature extraction techniques, ELA (Error Level Analysis) and PRNU (Photo Response Non-Uniformity). The model was trained on a dataset called CIFAKE which is made up of 100,000 images for training (50,000 real and 50,000 fake), as well as 20,000 images for testing (10,000 real and 10,000 fake).
